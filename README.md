#Introduction
----------

GOODMaskedIconView is a UIView subclass that uses black-and-white masks to draw icons of different
styles at various sizes and resolutions. It uses the same technique as
UITabBar to generate disparate effects with a single icon file.

GOODMaskedIconView accepts common image formats and PDFs, the native vector file format of iOS and
OS X. PDFs are bestâ€”they're easy to maintain and resolution independent.

#Examples
---------

###Create a green icon from a PNG

    GOODMaskedIconView *iconView = [[GOODMaskedIconView alloc] initWithResourceNamed:@"icon.png"]
    iconView.color = [UIColor greenColor];
    [self.view addSubview:iconView];

###Create a red icon from a UIImage

    UIImage *image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"icon.png"];
    GOODMaskedIconView *iconView = [[GOODMaskedIconView alloc] initWithImage:image];
    iconView.color = [UIColor redColor];
    [self.view addSubview:iconView];

###Resize a PDF icon

    GOODMaskedIconView *iconView = [[GOODMaskedIconView alloc] initWithPDFNamed:@"icon.pdf" size:CGSizeMake(32.0f, 26.0f)];
    [self.view addSubview:iconView];

###Render a PDF icon into a UIButton

    GOODMaskedIconView *iconView = [[GOODMaskedIconView alloc] initWithResourceNamed:@"icon.pdf"];
    iconView.color = [UIColor magentaColor];
    iconView.highlightedColor = [UIColor orangeColor];
    UIButton *button = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom];
    [button setImage:[iconView renderImage] forState:UIControlStateNormal]
    [button setImage:[iconView renderHighlightedImage] forState:UIControlStateHighlighted];
    [self.view addSubview:button];

#How to use
-----------

###First: Clone into a submodule

In your project's folder, type:

    git submodule add git://github.com/peyton/GOODMaskedIconView.git

A submodule allows your repository to contain a clone of an external
project. If you don't want a submodule, use:

    git clone git://github.com/peyton/GOODMaskedIconView.git

###Next: Add classes

Drag `GOODMaskedIconView.h` and `GOODMaskedIconView.m` into your Xcode
project's file browser.

*Note:* An options dialog will pop up. If you're using GOODMaskedIconView as a submodule,
you should uncheck "Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)."

###Then: Import the header

    #import "GOODMaskedIconView.h"

###Later: Update to the latest version

`cd` into the GOODMaskedIconView directory and run:

    git pull

#Scalable icons with PDFs
---------

GOODMaskedIconView makes it easy to use PDF icons, eliminating "\*@2x.\*" files.
Many Apple applications on OS X use PDF icons for resolution independence.

Next to the network, the biggest source of latency on an iPhone is the disk. For small, simple icons the PDF format adds about 3KB of overhead over PNG.
Because the iPhone's page size is 4KB, in practice the difference in loading time is nothing. For larger icons a PDF of vectors can *save* space.

Some editors need a little massaging to export PDFs suitable for
iOS icons. Here are [instructions](https://github.com/peyton/GOODMaskedIconView/wiki/Exporting-PDFs).
